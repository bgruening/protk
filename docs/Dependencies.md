# Protk Dependencies

Protk provides a setup script to install dependencies so hopefully you will never need these instructions.  In case things go wrong this page provides some information on building dependencies from scratch

# TPP

First download the sources

```bash
	wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/sashimi/files/Trans-Proteomic%20Pipeline%20%28TPP%29/TPP%20v4.8%20%28philae%29%20rev%200/TPP_4.8.0-src.tgz/download -O TPP_4.8.0-src.tgz
	tar -zxvf TPP_4.8.0-src.tgz
	cd TPP-4.8.0
```

Building the TPP on MacOSX requires numerous small modifications to the source code.
